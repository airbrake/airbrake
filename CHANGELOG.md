Airbrake Changelog
==================

### master

* **IMPORTANT:** support for Ruby 1.9.2, 1.9.3 & JRuby (1.9-mode) is dropped
  ([#646](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/646))
* Fixed unwanted authentication when calling `current_user`, when Warden is
  present ([#643](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/643))
* Stopped collecting HTTP request bodies by default, which started happening
  since [v5.6.1](#v561-october-24-2016). Due to security concerns we now make
  this behaviour optional. Users who need this information can use a new
  predefined builder called `Airbrake::Rack::RequestBodyBuilder`
  ([#650](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/650))

### [v5.6.1][v5.6.1] (October 24, 2016)

* Fixed Rails bug with regard to the `current_user` method signature having
  parameters, while the library expected none
  ([#619](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/619))
* Started collecting HTTP request body for Rack compliant apps
  ([#624](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/624))

### [v5.6.0][v5.6.0] (October 18, 2016)

* Added support for multiple notifiers for Rack middleware
  ([#515](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/515))
* Started depending on
  [airbrake-ruby-1.6.0](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

### [v5.5.0][v5.5.0] (September 14, 2016)

* Started depending on
  [airbrake-ruby-1.5.0](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

### [v5.4.5][v5.4.5] (August 23, 2016)

* Fixed possible SystemStackError when using ActiveJob integration
  ([#593](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/593))

### [v5.4.4][v5.4.4] (August 10, 2016)

* **IMPORTANT**: fixed ActiveJob integration not re-raising exceptions, which
  resulted into marking failed jobs as successfully completed
  ([#591](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/issues/591))
* Fixed Rails runner integration not reporting errors
  ([#585](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/issues/585))
* Fixed bug with the [enum_field](https://github.com/jamesgolick/enum_field) gem
  raising errors in Rails apps due to constant names collision. As the result,
  the library does not leak `MyModel::KINDS` constants for every Rails model
  ([#588](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/588))

### [v5.4.3][v5.4.3] (July 22, 2016)

* **IMPORTANT**: Fixed support for apps, which don't use ActiveRecord. In v5.4.2
  it broke, so it's recommended to upgrade to the current version (or use v5.4.1
  instead) ([#580](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/issues/580))

### [v5.4.2][v5.4.2] (July 15, 2016)

### [v5.4.1][v5.4.1] (June 21, 2016)

* Fixed Capistrano 3 bug when system has conflicting Rake versions, which would
  raise `Gem::LoadError` ([#564](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/564))

### [v5.4.0][v5.4.0] (June 6, 2016)

* Started depending on
  [airbrake-ruby-1.4.0](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

### [v5.3.0][v5.3.0] (May 11, 2016)

* Fixed bug when trying to send a test exception with help of the Rake task
  results in an error due to the current environment being ignored
  ([#523](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/523))
* Added support for reporting critical exceptions that terminate the process.
  This bit of functionality was moved from
  [airbrake-ruby](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/pull/61)

* Removed the hostname information from the Rack integration because the new
  `airbrake-ruby` sends it by default
  ([#495](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/495))

### [v5.0.3][v5.0.3] (January 19, 2016)

* Improved RubyMine support
  ([#469](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/469))
