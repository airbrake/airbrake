* Fixed broken `bundle exec rake airbrake:deploy`
  ([#1003](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/1003))
* Introduced `Airbrake::Rails.logger`, which replaces the old way of configuring

  ```

### [v9.4.0][v9.4.0] (July 29, 2019)

* Added the new `max_retries` optional parameter to
  `Airbrake::Sidekiq::RetryableJobsFilter`:

  ```ruby
  Airbrake::Sidekiq::RetryableJobsFilter.new(max_retries: 10)
  ```

  It configures the amount of allowed job retries that won't trigger an Airbrake
  notification. After it's exhausted, Airbrake will start sending errors again
  ([#979](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/979))
* Rails: started logging to `airbrake.log` by default. This affects only new
  Rails apps. Apps that already use Airbrake have to update the logger manually
  (not mandatory). Please consult README for instructions
  ([#986](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/986))
* Added support for `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT`. This variable redirects all Airbrake
  logging to STDOUT, despite the configured logger

  reported through Rack environment (such as `rack.exception`)
  ([#977](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/977))

  happens the first time a job fails)
  ([#980](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/980))
* Started depending on airbrake-ruby
  [v4.5.0](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/releases/tag/v4.5.0) and
  higher ([#982](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake/pull/982)).
  **IMPORTANT:** in this update we enabled `performance_stats` by default. If
  you wish to disable it, set `config.performance_stats = false`

### [v9.2.2][v9.2.2] (May 10, 2019)
