HoptoadNotifier
===============

This is the notifier plugin for integrating apps with Hoptoad.

When an uncaught exception occurs, HoptoadNotifier will POST the relevant data 
to the Hoptoad server specified in your environment.


INSTALLATION

From your project's RAILS_ROOT, run:

	piston import https://svn.thoughtbot.com/plugins/hoptoad_notifier/trunk vendor/plugin/hoptoad_notifier
	

CONFIGURATION

You should have something like this in your environment.rb file (or 
config/initializers/hoptoad.rb in rails 2).

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.host         = 'hoptoad.thoughtbot.com'
    config.port         = 80
    config.project_name = 'my fancy application'
    config.ignore       = ['ActiveRecord::IgnoreThisError']
  end
  
Then, to enable hoptoad in your appication, include this code...

  include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher

...at the top of your ApplicationController, and all exceptions will be logged 
to Hoptoad where they can be aggregated, filtered, sorted, analyzed, massaged 
and searched.

You can test that hoptoad is working in your production environment by using 
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake hoptoad:test RAILS_ENV=production

If everything is configured properly, that task will send a notice to hoptoad 
which will be visible immediately.


USAGE

For the most part, hoptoad works for itself.  Once you've included the notifier 
in your ApplicationController, all errors will be rescued by the 
#rescue_action_in_public provided by the plugin.

If you want to log arbitrary things which you've rescued yourself from a 
controller, you can do something like this:

  ...
  rescue => ex
    inform_hoptoad(ex)
    flash[:failure] = 'Encryptions could not be rerouted, try again.'
  end
  ...

The #inform_hoptoad call will send the notice over to hoptoad for later 
analysis.


FILTERING

You can specify a whitelist of errors, that Hoptoad will not report on.  Use this feature when you are so apathetic to certain errors that you don't want them even logged.  If you simply don't want to receive email notifications for certain errors, consider using the filters on the Hoptoad server application.

Hoptoad ignores the following exceptions by default:
  ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
  CGI::Session::CookieStore::TamperedWithCookie
  
To ignore errors in addition to those, specify their names in your Hoptoad configuration block.

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.host         = 'hoptoad.thoughtbot.com'
    config.project_name = 'my fancy application'
    config.ignore       = ['ActiveRecord::IgnoreThisError']
  end

To ignore *only* certain errors (and override the defaults), use the #ignore_only attribute.

  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.host         = 'hoptoad.thoughtbot.com'
    config.project_name = 'my fancy application'
    config.ignore_only  = ['ActiveRecord::IgnoreThisError']
  end


TESTING

When you run your tests, you might notice that the hoptoad service is recording 
notices generated using #inform_hoptoad when you don't expect it to.  You can 
use code like this in your test_helper.rb to redefine that method so those 
errors are not reported while running tests.

	module HoptoadNotifier::Catcher
	  def inform_hoptoad(thing)
	    # do nothing.
	  end
	end
