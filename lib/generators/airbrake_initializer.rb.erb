# Airbrake is an online tool that provides robust exception tracking in your Rails
# applications. In doing so, it allows you to easily review errors, tie an error
# to an individual piece of code, and trace the cause back to recent
# changes. Airbrake enables for easy categorization, searching, and prioritization
# of exceptions so that when errors occur, your team can quickly determine the
# root cause.
#
# Configuration details:
# https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#configuration
Airbrake.configure do |c|
  # You must set both project_id & project_key. To find your project_id and
  # project_key navigate to your project's General Settings and copy the values
  # from the right sidebar.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#project_id--project_key
<% if project_id -%>
  c.project_id = <%= project_id %>
<% else -%>
  c.project_id = ENV['AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_ID']
<% end -%>
<% if project_key -%>
  c.project_key = '<%= project_key %>'
<% else -%>
  c.project_key = ENV['AIRBRAKE_API_KEY']
<% end -%>

  # Configures the root directory of your project. Expects a String or a
  # Pathname, which represents the path to your project. Providing this option
  # helps us to filter out repetitive data from backtrace frames and link to
  # GitHub files from our dashboard.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#root_directory
  c.root_directory = Rails.root

  # By default, Airbrake Ruby outputs to STDOUT. In Rails apps it makes sense to
  # use the Rails' logger.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#logger
  c.logger = Rails.logger

  # Configures the environment the application is running in. Helps the Airbrake
  # dashboard to distinguish between exceptions occurring in different
  # environments. By default, it's not set.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#environment
  c.environment = Rails.env

  # Setting this option allows Airbrake to filter exceptions occurring in
  # unwanted environments such as :test. By default, it is equal to an empty
  # Array, which means Airbrake Ruby sends exceptions occurring in all
  # environments.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#ignore_environments
  c.ignore_environments = %w(test)
end

# If Airbrake doesn't send any expected exceptions, we suggest to uncomment the
# line below. It might simplify debugging of background Airbrake workers, which
# can silently die.
# Thread.abort_on_exception = ['test', 'development'].include?(Rails.env)
