# Airbrake is an online tool that provides robust exception tracking in your Rails
# applications. In doing so, it allows you to easily review errors, tie an error
# to an individual piece of code, and trace the cause back to recent
# changes. Airbrake enables for easy categorization, searching, and prioritization
# of exceptions so that when errors occur, your team can quickly determine the
# root cause.
#
# Configuration details:
# https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#configuration
Airbrake.configure do |c|
  # You must set both project_id & project_key. To find your project_id and
  # project_key navigate to your project's General Settings and copy the values
  # from the right sidebar.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#project_id--project_key
<% if project_id -%>
  c.project_id = <%= project_id %>
<% else -%>
  c.project_id = ENV['AIRBRAKE_PROJECT_ID']
<% end -%>
<% if project_key -%>
  c.project_key = '<%= project_key %>'
<% else -%>
  c.project_key = ENV['AIRBRAKE_API_KEY']
<% end -%>

  # Configures the root directory of your project. Expects a String or a
  # Pathname, which represents the path to your project. Providing this option
  # helps us to filter out repetitive data from backtrace frames and link to
  # GitHub files from our dashboard.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#root_directory
  c.root_directory = Rails.root

  # By default, Airbrake Ruby outputs to STDOUT. In Rails apps it makes sense to
  # use the Rails' logger.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#logger
  c.logger = Rails.logger

  # Configures the environment the application is running in. Helps the Airbrake
  # dashboard to distinguish between exceptions occurring in different
  # environments.
  # NOTE: This option must be set in order to make the 'ignore_environments'
  # option work.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#environment
  c.environment = Rails.env

  # Setting this option allows Airbrake to filter exceptions occurring in
  # unwanted environments such as :test.
  # NOTE: This option *does not* work if you don't set the 'environment' option.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#ignore_environments
  c.ignore_environments = %w(test development)

  # A list of parameters that should be filtered out of what is sent to
  # Airbrake. By default, all "password" attributes will have their contents
  # replaced.
  # https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby#blacklist_keys
  c.blacklist_keys = [/password/i, /authorization/i]

  # Alternatively, you can integrate with Rails' filter_parameters.
  # Read more: https://goo.gl/gqQ1xS
  # c.blacklist_keys = Rails.application.config.filter_parameters

# A filter that collects request body information. Enable it if you are sure you
# don't send sensitive information to Airbrake in your body (such as passwords).
# https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake#requestbodyfilter
# Airbrake.add_filter(Airbrake::Rack::RequestBodyFilter.new)

# Attaches thread & fiber local variables along with general thread information.
# Airbrake.add_filter(Airbrake::Filters::ThreadFilter.new)

# Attaches loaded dependencies to the notice object
# (under context/versions/dependencies).
# Airbrake.add_filter(Airbrake::Filters::DependencyFilter.new)

# If you want to convert your log messages to Airbrake errors, we offer an
# integration with the Logger class from stdlib.
# https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake#logger
# Rails.logger = Airbrake::AirbrakeLogger.new(Rails.logger)
